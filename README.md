## Introduction
The field of geoscience has amassed a vast amount of data, necessitating the extraction and integration of diverse knowledge from this data to address global change challenges, promote sustainable development, and accelerate scientific discovery. Foundation language models initially learn and integrate knowledge autonomously through self-supervised pre-training on extensive text data. Subsequently, they acquire the capability to solve geoscience problems through instruction tuning. However, when the foundational language models lack sufficient geoscience expertise, instruction tuning with relevant data can lead to the generation of content that is inconsistent with established facts. To improve the model's accuracy and practicality, a robust geoscience foundational language model is urgently needed.<br>

This study uses [Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) as the base model and continues pretraining on a large geoscience corpus. It also incorporates the [domain-specific large language model *pre*-pretraining framework (PreparedLLM)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20964471.2024.2396159) and the "two-stage pre-adaptation pre-training" algorithm to build the geoscience large language model, JiuZhou.

## Inference
Below is an example of inference code using JiuZhou-Instruct-v0.2.
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

device = torch.device("cuda:0") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")

model_path = "itpossible/JiuZhou-Instruct-v0.2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=device)

text = "What is geoscience?"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": text}]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
outputs_id = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=600, do_sample=True)
outputs = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs_id, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(outputs)
```

## Model Performance

### Geoscience Ability
We evaluate the performance of JiuZhou using the GeoBench benchmark.<br>
JiuZhou outperforms GPT-3.5 in objective tasks:

    <br>
</p>

JiuZhou also scores higher than ClimateChat across six criteria in subjective tasks:

    <br>
</p>

### General Ability

We evaluate the performance of Chinese-Mistral-7B using three benchmark datasets: C-Eval, CMMLU, and MMLU.<br>
Compared to other variants of Llama and Mistral models, JiuZhou shows outstanding performance:
